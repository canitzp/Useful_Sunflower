## About
### Sunflower Seeds
Your average sunflower now produces seeds.
Collect them by destroying the sunflower and crafting it to the "Sunflower Head".
This then displays how many seeds it contains.

You also can craft a "Seed Pouch" and right click on the sunflower, to get its seeds.
This also has the advantage of replanting the sunflower and not use up so much inventory space.
The pouch can hold 100k seeds.
The "Seed Pouch" can directly transfer its seeds to a Squeezer.

### Squeezer
The Squeezer is a machine to turn your sunflower seeds into useful stuff.
It always needs sunflower seeds as input, just click the sunflower head or with your seed pouch on it to fill it up.
It can hold 100k seeds and needs different amount for different recipes.
