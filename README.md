# Useful Sunflower

### Support:

- 1.18.2: fully supported

#### Conversions:

1kg = 10k Seeds = 0.7l

### Ideas:

- Seed collector
  - Block that automatically collects seeds from nearby (<= 2m) sunflowers.
  - Pushes the seeds into nearby blocks (eg: squeezer, container, ...)
- Seed cables/pipes?
- Use seeds as food for chicken -> currently not possible, since entity food is hardcoded
- vegan milk from seeds and water
- use sunflower oil as slime alternative
- make certain items compostable

### Needed textures:
- Seed container
- roasted sunflower seeds bowl -> replaces roasted seeds bag

## About
### Seed pouch
The seed pouch is a storage bag for sunflower seeds.
Right-click on any the sunflower, to get its seeds (the sunflower is not harvested).
Sneak-right-click to collect the whole plant.
Right-click on grass to plant a new sunflower.
The pouch can hold 100k seeds.
The "Seed Pouch" can directly transfer its seeds to machines.

### Sunflower stem and head
Items that are used to craft other stuff.
Can be collected when sneak-right-clicking a grown sunflower, while holding a seed pouch (seeds still get collected).

### Sunflower oil
Nice and sticky yellow juice in a glass bottle.
Created by squeezing enough sunflower seeds into an empty glass bottle.
Can be used as a replacement for regular slime balls.

### Roasted sunflower seeds
A fast made food from sunflower seeds.
A delicious snack, adding 3 nutrition points and a 0.3 saturation multiplier to the player.

### Sunflower bread
Bread made from sunflowers, well not directly, first you have to craft flour out of the seeds.
Adds the same stats as normal bread to the player.
Since it is pretty easy to craft, it is a good early game food choice (if you can find sunflowers ;D).

### Sunflower coffee
Who doesn't like a good full mug of hot coffee? (well me, since I haven't drunk coffee in ages xd)
Coffee is a little more difficult to craft.
You first need to craft a couple of mugs and fill them with powdered sunflower seeds.
Then you can fill the mugs with water, and heat these mugs up in an oven.
If you're planning a nether trip, take cold coffee with you, the nether will heat it up instantly ;D.

### Squeezer
The Squeezer is a machine to turn your sunflower seeds into useful stuff.
It always needs sunflower seeds as input, just click the sunflower head or with your seed pouch on it to fill it up.
It can hold 100k seeds and needs different amount for different recipes.

### Seed bin
Is a block which can be used to store large amount of seeds.
Right click with a seed containing item to fill it up or drain it.
It can hold 4 million seeds and automatically pushes seeds to neighbouring blocks, if they need them (eg: squeezer).
